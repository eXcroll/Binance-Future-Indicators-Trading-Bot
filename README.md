Paste your API into the appropriate fields in the code, use CTRL+F to find all the lines where you need to enter API keys. 
The bot trades on 2 indicators (can be changed in the code) RSI and Bollinger bands by changing the variable POINTS_TO_ENTER = 2
You can set points to enter the transaction, now they are +1 on RSI and + 1 on Bollinger, the same logic for sale. The bot is not 100% finalized, but it sometimes showed me profits and more often losses, it needs to be tested and configured, which I don't want.
It would be even better to attach a database to it, but this is optional.
