Paste your API into the appropriate fields in the code, use CTRL+F to find all the lines where you need to enter API keys.<br />
The bot trades on 2 indicators (can be changed in the code) <b>RSI</b> and <b>Bollinger</b> bands by changing the variable <b>POINTS_TO_ENTER = 2 </b> <br />
You can set points to enter the transaction, now they are +1 on RSI and + 1 on Bollinger, the same logic for sale. The bot is not 100% finalized, but it sometimes showed me profits and more often losses, it needs to be tested and configured, which I don't want.<br />
It would be even better to attach a database to it, but this is optional.<br />

<b>Attention! This bot is not finalized and not configured until the final, so be careful when trading on the stock exchange, I am not responsible for your possible financial losses. </b>
